<p>Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park is one of the largest urban parks in Singapore located along Ang Mo Kio Avenue 1, stretching from Upper Thomson Road to Bishan Road. It is divided into two halves: the Pond Gardens half closer to Upper Thomson Road, and the River Plains half closer to Bishan Road.</p>

<p>Originally called Bishan Park in 1988, the park was renovated under PUB's Active, Beautiful, Clean Waters (ABC Waters) Programme that naturalized the old concrete canal that chanels the Kallang River into a waterway with wild plants growing along the river banks. It also incorporated the existing natural forest and features a frangipani garden, a palm court lined with palm trees and a lake with a floating amphitheatre. There is jogging and cycling tracks, a fitness corner, a football field and a multi-purpose court, among other features. </p>

<p>Bishan Park was also the first park in Singapore to be made accessible via the park connector network, which links it to Braddell Road. It was built to allow users to jog or cycle from one park to another seamlessly.</p>
