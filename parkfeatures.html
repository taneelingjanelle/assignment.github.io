<h2>The canal</h2>
<p>An iconic feature of Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park is the naturalised river meandering through it. Aquatic animals and birds can usually be spotted along the three-kilometere waterway. Visitors can walk down the gentle river banks to get closer to the water; but during heavy rain, the parkland next to the river doubles up as a conveyance channel and carries excess water downstream. </p>

<p>An award-winning sculpture, An Enclosure for a Swing by Kelvin Lim Fun Kit can be found at the top of a mound which is created by stacking the concrete slabs from the original canal. The top of the hill offers a good view of the entire park. </p> <br>
